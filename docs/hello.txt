hello there! how are you? This is an example of a tweet (or whatever they are called now) that is longer than two hundred and eighty characters in length. Such a string would not be able to be a single tweet (maybe they are called posts now), but would have to be split up into chunks. It's pretty easy to split up strings by hand as well as number them by hand, but for me it still takes more concentration than feels worth the cost. Why not let our computer friends (who love strings by the way!) take care of it for us? I think it sounds reasonable.
