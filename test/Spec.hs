        \ Enter Mariners. \
        \ Boats. Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! yare, yare! Take in the topsail. \
        \ Tend to the master’s whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough! \
        \ Enter Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Ferdinand, Gonzalo, and others. \
        \ Alon. Good boatswain, have care. Where’s the master? Play the men. \
        \ Boats. I pray now, keep below. \
        \ Ant. Where is the master, boatswain? \
        \ Boats. Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your cabins: you do assist the storm. \
        \ Gon. Nay, good, be patient. \
        \ Boats. When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers for the name of king? \
        \ To cabin: silence! trouble us not. \
        \ Gon. Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard. \
        \ Boats. None that I more love than myself. You are a 20 Counsellor; \
        \ if you can command these elements to silence, and work the peace of the present, \
        \ we will not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks \
        \ you have lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance \
        \ of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good I. 1. 25 hearts! Out of our way, I say. \
        \ Exit. \
        \ Gon. I have great comfort from this fellow: \
        \ methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him; \
        \ his complexion is perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:\
        \ make the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth 30 little advantage.\
        \ If he be not born to be hanged, our case is miserable."
